This is a forking and extensible micro web server written in C and Lua that
can serve static files and dynamic generated Lua pages.

It can run standard Lua scripts either via command line, file or by
interactive shell.

It can also be used as a text scanner like AWK using Lua pattern matching
syntax.

Scripts can be compiled to machine portable bytecode.
